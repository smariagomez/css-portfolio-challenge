            <div id="paragraph">
                <p>My road to web development was not a direct one. After a 14-year-long career in speech-language
                    pathology, I began to crave something new; a path that would offer different opportunities to apply
                    my problem solving and analytical thinking. Before taking the leap into the intensive UW Coding Boot
                    Camp, I spent hours completing free HTML and CSS tutorials. Not having considered myself a
                    “tech-person” I was surprised that during that time I was eager to return to my computer and explore
                    different ways to apply the knowledge that I was gaining. Eventually, and it didn’t take long, I
                    came to the realization that my quality of life and sense of career fulfillment would improve
                    exponentially if I took the leap into web development.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>So here I am, a current UW Coding Boot Camp student who is finding joy in gaining new skills,
                    collaborating and brainstorming with my cohort and creating applications that I am increasingly
                    proud of. When I’m not doing the above, you’ll probably find me cycling around the city, hiking in
                    the mountains or floating on a lake. Thank you for taking the time to view my profile and I hope to
                    have the opportunity to speak with you in the future.</p>
