            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div>
                <p>My road to web development was not a direct one.  After a 14-year-long career in speech-language pathology, I began to crave something new; a path that would offer different opportunities to apply my problem solving and analytical thinking.  Before taking the leap into the intensive UW Coding Boot Camp, I spent hours completing free HTML and CSS tutorials.  Not having considered myself a “tech-person” I was surprised that during that time I was eager to return to my computer and explore different ways to apply the knowledge that I was gaining.  Eventually, and it didn’t take long, I came to the realization that my quality of life and sense of career fulfillment would improve exponentially if I took the leap into web development.</p>
                <p>So here I am, a current UW Coding Boot Camp student who is finding joy in gaining new skills, collaborating and brainstorming with my cohort and creating applications that I am increasingly proud of.  When I’m not doing the above, you’ll probably find me cycling around the city, hiking in the mountains or floating on a lake. Thank you for taking the time to view my profile and I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you in the future.</p>
